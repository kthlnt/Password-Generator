## Password Generator

## Description 

This is a password generator created with user preference in mind. The user is able to select whether or not they would like certain characters, numbers, upper or lower case to be in their randomly generated 10 charcter password. It is then displayed on the screen and ready for the user to use, or continue to generate new passwords.

This is highly usable in order for anyone to create a good, strong password in this day and age instead of reusing an old and most likely data breached password.
